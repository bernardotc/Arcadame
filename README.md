# Arcadame

Arcadame is a programming language done for the module "Compiler Design" of Tec de Monterrey.

Arcadame's goal is to be a basic programming language and game engine that handles simple 2D games (_The most complex game donse so far is a basic implementation of "Frogger"_).

In this repository you can find:
  1. A simple interface to run the entire language.
  2. The source code of the compiler (scanner and parser).
  3. The soruce code of the virtual machine.
  4. Code examples of the language Arcadame.
  5. A test about the execution memory of the virtual machine in terms of time efficiency.

**Note:** To succeed in running the compiler, you need:
  * To have Python in your machine, preferebly 2.7.11.
  * To install PLY.
  * To install Pygame.
